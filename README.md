# GarbageMonitoring_TW
The GaMon Web application will provide a way to monitor household sanitation, through which users will be informed about the current situation of garbage storage spaces 
in different areas, in order to selectively collect waste and decongest it. Using the application on a large scale will help to maintain cleanliness, prevent the 
accumulation of waste in the designated spaces and improve the time of garbage collection because the authorized personnel in this field will be able to easily manage 
the statistics, by simply accessing the application.

## The main functionalities of the application are:

##### 1. Admin and authorized staff will be able to log in based on credentials to do some special actions in the app.
##### 2. Citizens will be able to fill out a form in order to inform users about the state of waste for each area.
##### 3. Citizens will be able to fill out a form to report incidents of inadequate waste storage.
##### 4. Citizens will be able to fill in a form if they want to contact the staff to ask different questions or to communicate something in particular.
##### 5. Users will be able to view statistics created based on the forms, in the form of graphs and tables.
##### 6. Authorized personnel will be able to notify the fact that waste has been collected in an area, through a "reset" button.
##### 7. The application supports an interactive map so that users can easily track the areas where there are waste collection points.
##### 8. The admin will update the number of containers needed for an area, depending on the status of each area (in an area where waste is collected more often, he will add containers).
##### 9. Users will be able to access a page where additional information can be found on the collection, sorting and recycling of waste.
##### 10. Users will be able to read information about an awareness campaign about the importance of protecting the environment.
